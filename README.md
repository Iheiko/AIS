# AIS
Just a regular script to install Archlinux. Mostly targeted on VirtualBox with EFI.

##How to use
This script was made only for my personal use. If you really want to try it, follow this:
1. Make sure you enabled EFI in your VB settings.
2. Boot Arch live media
3. `wget raw.githubusercontent.com/Iheiko/AIS/master/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`
4. Reboot
